The ***Student Performance*** dataset provides detailed information on students’ demographic backgrounds and their academic achievements across three subjects: math, reading, and writing. It contains **202 rows** and **8 columns**, where each row represents an individual student.

**Data Column Descriptions**
* race_ethnicity  (object): Different racial groups  
* parental_level_of_education (object): The educational background of the student's family  
* math_score (int): Performance in math  
* reading_score (int): Performance in reading  
* writing_score (int): Performance in writing skills
* total_score (int): The sum of math, reading, and writing scores
* average_score (float): The mean of the three subject scores

The dataset is designed to explore how factors such as gender, race ethnicity, and parental education influence student performance.
